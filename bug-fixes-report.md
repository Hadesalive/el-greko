# Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs found and fixed in the El Greco restaurant application codebase.

## Bug 1: Memory Leak in Toast Hook - Extremely Long Toast Display Time

### Issue Description
The toast notification system had a critical performance issue where toasts were set to remain visible for 1,000,000 milliseconds (approximately 16.7 minutes). This created a memory leak as toast notifications would accumulate in memory for an extremely long time and users would experience toasts that never disappear.

### Location
- **File**: `hooks/use-toast.ts`
- **Line**: 12

### Root Cause
The `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` constant was set to `1000000` (1 million milliseconds) instead of a reasonable duration for toast notifications.

### Fix Applied
Changed `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` from `1000000` to `3000` (3 seconds), which is a standard duration for toast notifications.

### Impact
- **Before**: Toasts stayed visible for 16.7 minutes, causing memory accumulation
- **After**: Toasts disappear after 3 seconds, preventing memory leaks and improving UX

## Bug 2: LocalStorage Error Handling - Potential Application Crashes

### Issue Description
Multiple functions in the application were accessing localStorage without proper error handling. This could cause the application to crash in environments where localStorage is disabled (e.g., private browsing mode, certain browser configurations, or when storage quota is exceeded).

### Location
- **File**: `lib/cart-storage.ts` - Functions: `getCartFromStorage`, `saveCartToStorage`, `clearCart`
- **File**: `components/theme-provider.tsx` - Two useEffect hooks

### Root Cause
Direct access to localStorage without try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions such as:
- `SecurityError` when localStorage is disabled
- `QuotaExceededError` when storage limit is reached
- `TypeError` when localStorage is not available

### Fix Applied
Wrapped all localStorage operations in try-catch blocks with appropriate error handling:

1. **Cart Storage Functions**:
   - `getCartFromStorage()`: Returns empty array on error
   - `saveCartToStorage()`: Logs warning on error, continues execution
   - `clearCart()`: Logs warning on error, still returns empty array

2. **Theme Provider**:
   - Theme loading: Falls back to default theme on error
   - Theme saving: Logs warning on error, continues execution

### Impact
- **Before**: Application could crash when localStorage fails
- **After**: Application gracefully handles localStorage failures and continues functioning

## Bug 3: Duplicated Function - Code Redundancy

### Issue Description
The food database module contained two identical functions that perform the same operation: `getFoodById` and `getFoodItemById`. This redundancy could lead to:
- Confusion about which function to use
- Maintenance overhead
- Potential inconsistencies if one function is updated and the other isn't

### Location
- **File**: `lib/food-database.ts`
- **Lines**: 856 (`getFoodById`) and 917 (`getFoodItemById`)

### Root Cause
Code duplication, possibly from refactoring or different developers adding similar functionality without checking for existing implementations.

### Fix Applied
Removed the duplicate `getFoodItemById` function and added a comment explaining that `getFoodById` should be used for consistency.

### Impact
- **Before**: Two functions doing the same thing, potential for confusion
- **After**: Single, consistent function for retrieving food items by ID

## Summary

All three bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. **Performance Issue**: Toast notifications now have a reasonable display duration (3 seconds instead of 16.7 minutes)
2. **Security/Stability Issue**: All localStorage operations are now wrapped in proper error handling
3. **Code Quality Issue**: Removed duplicate function to improve maintainability

These fixes improve the application's performance, stability, and maintainability while ensuring it works correctly across different browser environments and configurations.
